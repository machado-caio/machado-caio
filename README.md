# Hi there, I'm Caio Machado! 😊

## About Me 🚀
I'm a Senior Solutions Architect, carrying 11+ years of professional experience in the tech industry, specialized in backend solutions.

There are two things that drive me: the first is how fascinating it is to transform something abstract, like an idea, into software; and the second is to empower people to become their best selves.

🎓 I hold a Associates Degree in Computer Technology from Faculty Of Technology.\
🌱 I'm on track for learning more about Systems Design, Software Architecture, Leadership, Node.js and React.\
